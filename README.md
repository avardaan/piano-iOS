Version 1.21 of my Piano App for iOS is currently on the App Store.
Check it out - https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id1208260183?mt=8

Distinct features of the app include
  1. Option to play both major and minor Arpeggios and Chords by only pressing the root note
  2. Determine the interval between each note in the arpeggio
  3. Play 3 or 6 note arpeggios
  4. Choose a key and hide and/or mute all notes that are not in the key. This way, you'll never play a wrong note while improvising!

Code is heavily commented for anyone who wants to build something similar or on top of my app. Feel free to contact me and ask questions :)
